This repo is for the better understanding of how pyexcel works

pyexcel provides one application programming interface to read, manipulate and write data in various excel formats. This library makes information processing involving excel files an enjoyable task. The data in excel files can be turned into array or dict with minimal code and vice versa. This library focuses on data processing using excel files as storage media hence fonts, colors and charts were not and will not be considered.

The idea originated from the common usability problem: when an excel file driven web application is delivered for non-developer users (ie: team assistant, human resource administrator etc). The fact is that not everyone knows (or cares) about the differences between various excel formats: csv, xls, xlsx are all the same to them. Instead of training those users about file formats, this library helps web developers to handle most of the excel file formats by providing a common programming interface. To add a specific excel file format type to you application, all you need is to install an extra pyexcel plugin. Hence no code changes to your application and no issues with excel file formats any more. Looking at the community, this library and its associated ones try to become a small and easy to install alternative to Pandas.
